    <h1> Welcome to <span class="dodger-blue">David Spaulding</span>'s portfolio </h1>
    <h3> Software Engineer (in training) interested in travel, health, and good food! </h3>
    <p> You may find me traveling to new corners of the world, 
        exploring urban outlets, or stuffing face inside a new-found 
        restaurant. I enjoy learning about and employing new techniques for self-growth, 
        working in the gym, and learning new things!</p>
    <p>I am currently in the process of learning web-development in addition to pursuing software-engineering skills. 
        I look forward to mastering my software skills as I progress towards a career in software development.
