            <h3> Software Engineer (in training) interested in travel, health, and good food! </h3>
            <p> You may find me traveling to new corners of the world, 
            exploring urban outlets, or stuffing face inside a new-found 
            restaurant. I enjoy learning about and employing new techniques for self-growth, 
            working in the gym, and learning new things! </p>
            <p> I am currently in the process of learning web-development in addition to pursuing software-engineering skills. 
            I look forward to mastering my software skills as I progress towards a career in software development. </p>
